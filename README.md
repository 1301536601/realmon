# GCRealTimeMon
This is a monitoring tool that tells you when GCs happen in a .NET process and characteristics about these GCs.

Right now it's super simple - given a PID it will show you a few things about GCs as they happen in that process -

**Building**

Currently it's a VS solution. It uses the TraceEvent library.

**Contribution**

Contributions are very welcome! Tasks I'm currently thinking about -

+ Build with dotnet CLI in addition to a VS solution so folks can use this on Linux.
+ More info about GCs (the TraceGC class in TraceEvent provides a ton of info about each GC).
+ Take more command line args that allow uses to specify things like process name or only show GCs that are blocking/longer than Xms/etc.

If you are interested in working on any of these, your contributions are very much appreciated. Or if you have suggestions on other features, feel free to open an issue or a PR.
